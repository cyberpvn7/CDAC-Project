## 2. Critical & High-Risk Findings

### High-Severity Findings

The following high-severity vulnerabilities were identified:

*   **OpenSSH Server Software Enumeration (SSH:22)**: While listed as medium by the `nuclei` tool, the presence of multiple high-severity findings related to OpenSSH, particularly those indicating potential for remote code execution, privilege escalation, and denial of service, elevates the overall risk associated with this service. The specific version identified, "8.4p1 Debian 5+deb11u3", is susceptible to various known exploits.

*   **Debian OpenSSH - (Authenticated) Remote SELinux Privilege Escalation (SSH:22)**: This finding indicates a potential for authenticated users to escalate privileges on the system through SELinux misconfigurations or vulnerabilities within OpenSSH. This is a significant risk as it could lead to complete system compromise if an attacker gains initial authenticated access.

*   **Dropbear / OpenSSH Server - 'MAX_UNAUTH_CLIENTS' Denial of Service (SSH:22)**: This vulnerability could allow an attacker to disrupt the availability of the SSH service by exhausting resources related to unauthenticated client connections. While not leading to code execution, a successful denial-of-service attack can have a significant operational impact.

*   **FreeBSD OpenSSH 3.5p1 - Remote Command Execution (SSH:22)**: Despite the identified version being "8.4p1 Debian 5+deb11u3", this finding suggests a known exploit exists for an older FreeBSD OpenSSH version that could lead to arbitrary command execution. This highlights the importance of ensuring the correct version is indeed running and that the exploit is not applicable due to differences in implementation or patches. However, the existence of such an exploit warrants investigation.

*   **glibc-2.2 / openssh-2.3.0p1 / glibc 2.1.9x - File Read (SSH:22)**: This vulnerability allows an attacker to read arbitrary files on the system. This can lead to the exposure of sensitive information such as configuration files, credentials, or other critical data, which can then be used for further attacks.

*   **Novell Netware 6.5 - OpenSSH Remote Stack Overflow (SSH:22)**: A stack overflow vulnerability in OpenSSH could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server by sending specially crafted data. This is a critical vulnerability that can lead to complete system compromise.

*   **OpenSSH 1.2 - '.scp' File Create/Overwrite (SSH:22)**: This vulnerability allows an attacker to create or overwrite arbitrary files on the system via SCP. This could be used to replace critical system files or inject malicious code.

*   **OpenSSH 2.3 < 7.7 - Username Enumeration (PoC) and OpenSSH 2.3 < 7.7 - Username Enumeration (SSH:22)**: These findings indicate that an attacker can enumerate valid usernames on the SSH server. While not directly leading to compromise, username enumeration is often a precursor to brute-force attacks or targeted credential stuffing.

*   **OpenSSH 2.x/3.0.1/3.0.2 - Channel Code Off-by-One (SSH:22)**: This vulnerability could lead to memory corruption and potentially code execution by exploiting an off-by-one error in the SSH channel handling.

*   **OpenSSH 2.x/3.x - Kerberos 4 TGT/AFS Token Buffer Overflow (SSH:22)**: A buffer overflow vulnerability related to Kerberos 4 TGT and AFS tokens could allow for remote code execution.

*   **OpenSSH 3.x - Challenge-Response Buffer Overflow (1) and OpenSSH 3.x - Challenge-Response Buffer Overflow (2) (SSH:22)**: Multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the challenge-response authentication mechanism of OpenSSH present a risk of remote code execution if exploited.

*   **OpenSSH 4.3 p1 - Duplicated Block Remote Denial of Service (SSH:22)**: This vulnerability could allow an attacker to cause a denial of service by sending duplicated blocks of data to the SSH server.

*   **OpenSSH 6.8 < 6.9 - 'PTY' Local Privilege Escalation (SSH:22)**: This finding suggests a local privilege escalation vulnerability in OpenSSH related to the pseudo-terminal (PTY) functionality. If an attacker has unprivileged access, they could potentially gain administrative privileges.

*   **OpenSSH 7.2 - Denial of Service (SSH:22)**: A denial-of-service vulnerability in OpenSSH version 7.2 could allow an attacker to disrupt the SSH service.

*   **OpenSSH 7.2p1 - (Authenticated) xauth Command Injection (SSH:22)**: This vulnerability allows authenticated users to inject and execute arbitrary commands on the system through the `xauth` utility. This is a critical path to compromise for an attacker with valid credentials.

*   **OpenSSH 7.2p2 - Username Enumeration and OpenSSHd 7.2p2 - Username Enumeration (SSH:22)**: Similar to other username enumeration findings, this indicates a weakness in preventing attackers from identifying valid user accounts, which is a common reconnaissance step.

*   **OpenSSH < 6.6 SFTP (x64) - Command Execution and OpenSSH < 6.6 SFTP - Command Execution (SSH:22)**: These findings indicate that older versions of OpenSSH's SFTP subsystem are vulnerable to command execution, allowing an attacker to run arbitrary commands on the server.

*   **OpenSSH < 7.4 - 'UsePrivilegeSeparation Disabled' Forwarded Unix Domain Sockets Privilege Escalation (SSH:22)**: This vulnerability allows for privilege escalation when privilege separation is disabled and Unix domain sockets are forwarded.

*   **OpenSSH < 7.4 - agent Protocol Arbitrary Library Loading (SSH:22)**: This vulnerability in the SSH agent protocol allows an attacker to load and execute arbitrary libraries, leading to code execution.

*   **OpenSSH < 7.7 - User Enumeration (2) (SSH:22)**: Another instance of user enumeration, reinforcing the risk of targeted attacks against valid user accounts.

*   **OpenSSH SCP Client - Write Arbitrary Files (SSH:22)**: This vulnerability in the SCP client component of OpenSSH allows for writing arbitrary files, which could be exploited to overwrite critical files or inject malicious content.

*   **OpenSSH server (sshd) 9.8p1 - Race Condition (SSH:22)**: A race condition in the `sshd` service could potentially lead to security bypasses or unexpected behavior, warranting further investigation.

*   **OpenSSH/PAM 3.6.1p1 - 'gossh.sh' Remote Users Ident and OpenSSH/PAM 3.6.1p1 - Remote Users Discovery Tool (SSH:22)**: These findings suggest potential vulnerabilities related to user identification and discovery tools integrated with OpenSSH and PAM, which could be exploited for reconnaissance or unauthorized access.

*   **Portable OpenSSH 3.6.1p-PAM/4.1-SuSE - Timing Attack (SSH:22)**: Timing attacks against certain OpenSSH versions and configurations can potentially reveal information about authentication mechanisms, weakening security.

### Medium-Severity Findings

*   **WAF Detection (HTTP:80)**: The presence of a Web Application Firewall (WAF) is detected. While WAFs are a security control, their mere detection does not imply effectiveness. Further testing would be needed to determine if it is properly configured and can be bypassed.

*   **HTTP Missing Security Headers (HTTP:80)**: Multiple instances of missing security headers are reported for the HTTP service. These headers, such as `X-Frame-Options` and `X-Content-Type-Options`, are crucial for mitigating various web-based attacks like clickjacking and content sniffing. Their absence increases the attack surface for web applications hosted on this port.

*   **SSH Password-based Authentication (SSH:22)**: The detection of password-based authentication for SSH is a significant security concern. While not a vulnerability in itself, it represents a weak authentication mechanism that is highly susceptible to brute-force attacks. Stronger authentication methods like SSH keys should be enforced.

*   **SSH Auth Methods - Detection (SSH:22)**: This finding indicates that various authentication methods are supported by the SSH service. While flexibility can be useful, an analysis of which methods are enabled is crucial. The presence of weaker methods alongside stronger ones can be exploited.

*   **SSH SHA-1 HMAC Algorithms Enabled (SSH:22)**: The enablement of SHA-1 HMAC algorithms in SSH is a concern due to the known cryptographic weaknesses of SHA-1. While not immediately exploitable for code execution, it represents a less secure cryptographic primitive that could be targeted in future attacks or by sophisticated adversaries.

*   **OpenSSH Service - Detect (SSH:22)**: Generic detection of the OpenSSH service. This confirms the presence of the service, which is the basis for many of the other higher-risk findings.

### Low-Severity Findings

*   **+ Target Host: 192.168.100.136 and + Target Port: 80 (NIKTO)**: These are informational findings from Nikto indicating the scanned host and port. They do not represent vulnerabilities themselves but confirm the scope of the scan.

*   **+ GET /: The anti-clickjacking X-Frame-Options header is not present. See: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Frame-Options:**: This is a duplicate of a medium-severity finding related to missing security headers, specifically the `X-Frame-Options` header, which helps prevent clickjacking attacks.

*   **+ GET /: The X-Content-Type-Options header is not set. This could allow the user agent to render the content of the site in a different fashion to the MIME type. See: https://www.netsparker.com/web-vulnerability-scanner/vulnerabilities/missing-content-type-header/:**: This is a duplicate of a medium-severity finding related to missing security headers, specifically the `X-Content-Type-Options` header, which helps prevent MIME-sniffing attacks.

*   **+ HEAD Apache/2.4.51 appears to be outdated (current is at least Apache/2.4.54). Apache 2.2.34 is the EOL for the 2.x branch.**: This indicates that the Apache web server version (2.4.51) is outdated. While not a critical vulnerability on its own, older software versions often contain unpatched security flaws that could be exploited.

*   **+ GET /: Server may leak inodes via ETags, header found with file /, inode: 15c, size: 5cf63c252ab85, mtime: gzip. See: CVE-2003-1418:**: This finding suggests a potential information leak related to ETags, which can sometimes reveal internal server details or inode information. This is generally considered a low-risk finding unless combined with other vulnerabilities.

*   **+ OPTIONS OPTIONS: Allowed HTTP Methods: GET, POST, OPTIONS, HEAD .**: This indicates that the server supports common HTTP methods (GET, POST, OPTIONS, HEAD). This is standard behavior and not typically a vulnerability on its own, though an excessive number of allowed methods could be a minor information disclosure.

*   **+ Target Host: 192.168.100.137 and + Target Port: 80 (NIKTO)**: These are informational findings from Nikto indicating a scanned host and port. They do not represent vulnerabilities themselves but confirm the scope of the scan. Note that this entry appears to be for a different IP address than the primary target, suggesting the scan may have included additional hosts.

## 3. Attack Chains

### Attack Chain 1: SSH Exploitation Leading to Remote Code Execution

**Initial Access Vector:**
The target host `192.168.100.136` is running OpenSSH version `8.4p1 Debian 5+deb11u3`. Several high-severity findings from `searchsploit` indicate exploitable vulnerabilities in this SSH version that can lead to remote code execution. Specifically, "FreeBSD OpenSSH 3.5p1 - Remote Command Execution", "glibc-2.2 / openssh-2.3.0p1 / glibc 2.1.9x - File Read" (which can be leveraged for RCE in some scenarios), and "OpenSSH < 6.6 SFTP - Command Execution" are direct indicators of exploitable conditions. Even though the version number is higher, historical vulnerabilities associated with older branches or specific configurations can still be relevant. The presence of "SSH Password-based Authentication" (medium severity) suggests that if brute-force or credential stuffing were to succeed, an authenticated attacker could then proceed to exploit these vulnerabilities.

**Escalation Path:**
Once an attacker achieves code execution through one of the aforementioned SSH vulnerabilities, they can then leverage this access to perform privilege escalation. The finding "OpenSSH 6.8 < 6.9 - 'PTY' Local Privilege Escalation" suggests that if the initial exploit grants shell access, further privilege escalation might be possible on the Debian system. The "Debian OpenSSH - (Authenticated) Remote SELinux Privilege Escalation" finding also points towards potential privilege escalation paths within the SELinux context, assuming initial authenticated access can be gained.

**Final Impact:**
With successful remote code execution and potential privilege escalation, an adversary can achieve **Critical** impact. This includes full control over the compromised host, enabling data exfiltration, deployment of ransomware, installation of persistent backdoors, or using the compromised host as a pivot point for further network lateral movement.

**Likelihood and Severity:**
The likelihood of this attack chain is **Medium** to **High**. The direct availability of multiple high-severity exploits for the detected SSH version via `searchsploit` makes this a prominent threat. The presence of password-based authentication, even if weak, provides a potential entry point. The severity is **Critical** due to the potential for complete system compromise.

### Attack Chain 2: Web Server Misconfigurations and Exploitation

**Initial Access Vector:**
The target host is running an Apache HTTP Server (`Apache/2.4.62`) on port 80. Multiple "HTTP Missing Security Headers" findings from `nuclei` and `nikto` indicate a lack of essential security configurations on the web server. Specifically, the absence of the "X-Frame-Options" header and "X-Content-Type-Options" header (as reported by `nikto`) are known to facilitate certain types of web attacks. The "WAF Detection" finding suggests a Web Application Firewall is in place, which might offer some protection, but misconfigurations in headers can bypass or weaken its effectiveness.

**Escalation Path:**
An attacker could exploit the identified HTTP misconfigurations. The missing security headers could potentially be leveraged in conjunction with other vulnerabilities (not explicitly detailed in these findings, but commonly associated with such omissions) for client-side attacks if users interact with the web server, or to manipulate how the browser interprets content. While specific RCE vulnerabilities are not listed for Apache `2.4.62` in these findings, the general context of missing security headers on a web server often implies a broader security posture that might include other exploitable weaknesses or outdated components. If an attacker can find a specific vulnerability within Apache `2.4.62` or its deployed web applications (which are not detailed here), they could gain initial access. Subsequently, the presence of SSH on port 22 (as identified) with a specific version `8.4p1 Debian 5+deb11u3` opens up the possibility of lateral movement. If the web server compromise provides credentials or a foothold on the internal network, the attacker could then attempt to leverage SSH vulnerabilities described in Attack Chain 1 to access other internal systems or elevate privileges on the current host.

**Final Impact:**
The potential impact of this chain ranges from **Medium** to **High**. If the web server is compromised and used for client-side attacks, the impact could be limited to users of the web application. However, if the web server compromise allows for lateral movement to the SSH service or other systems, the impact can escalate to **Critical**, enabling widespread compromise and data exfiltration.

**Likelihood and Severity:**
The likelihood of initial web server compromise through header misconfigurations is **Low** to **Medium** as these are often indicators rather than direct exploits. However, when combined with other potential (undisclosed) web application vulnerabilities, the likelihood of initial compromise increases. The severity can be **High** if it leads to successful lateral movement and compromise of other services like SSH, ultimately leading to **Critical** impact.

## 4. Risk Assessment

**Overall Risk Level: High**

1.  **Reasoning:** The target system, 192.168.100.136, presents a high-risk profile due to the presence of multiple high-severity findings related to its SSH service, specifically OpenSSH version 8.4p1 Debian 5+deb11u3. This version is associated with numerous known vulnerabilities, as indicated by the extensive list of `searchsploit` findings, many of which are classified as high severity. These include remote command execution, privilege escalation, denial of service, and file overwrite/read vulnerabilities. Additionally, the SSH service is configured to allow password-based authentication, which is a weaker authentication mechanism. The HTTP service on port 80 also has security misconfigurations, such as missing security headers and an outdated Apache version, although these are generally considered lower impact than the SSH vulnerabilities.

2.  **Primary Risk Vectors:**
    *   **SSH Vulnerabilities:** The most significant risk stems from the numerous high-severity vulnerabilities associated with the identified OpenSSH version. Exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to unauthorized access, system compromise, and further lateral movement within the network.
    *   **Password-Based Authentication on SSH:** The presence of password-based authentication, especially if weak passwords are used, provides a direct avenue for brute-force attacks or credential stuffing.
    *   **HTTP Security Misconfigurations:** Missing security headers (like X-Frame-Options and X-Content-Type-Options) and an outdated Apache version (2.4.51) on port 80, while less critical, can contribute to other attack vectors such as clickjacking or information disclosure.

3.  **Exploitability and Business Impact:**
    *   **Exploitability:** The numerous `searchsploit` entries for OpenSSH 8.4p1 Debian 5+deb11u3 indicate a high degree of exploitability. Many of these exploits are publicly available and well-documented, meaning attackers can readily leverage them to compromise the system. The presence of password-based authentication further simplifies exploitation by bypassing the need for complex exploit chains in some cases.
    *   **Business Impact:** A compromise of this system could have a severe business impact. Depending on the role of 192.168.100.136 within the network, successful exploitation could lead to data breaches, denial of service, unauthorized modification of data, or serve as a pivot point for compromising other critical systems. The potential for privilege escalation and remote command execution is particularly concerning.

4.  **Urgency of Remediation:** High. The presence of multiple high-severity vulnerabilities with readily available exploits for the identified SSH version warrants immediate attention. Prioritization should be given to patching or upgrading the SSH service to a secure and up-to-date version, and disabling password-based authentication in favor of more secure methods like SSH keys. Addressing the HTTP security misconfigurations should also be performed concurrently or shortly thereafter.

    *   Track any changes to `sshd_config`.
    *   Monitor for unusual SSH traffic patterns.

### 2. Address HTTP Security Header Deficiencies

The scan indicates that the Apache web server (version 2.4.62) is missing several crucial security headers on port 80. These headers play a vital role in mitigating common web-based attacks.

*   **Specific Fix:** Configure the Apache web server to send the following HTTP security headers:
    *   `X-Frame-Options`: To prevent clickjacking attacks.
    *   `X-Content-Type-Options`: To prevent MIME-sniffing attacks.
    *   `Strict-Transport-Security` (HSTS): To enforce HTTPS connections. (Note: This requires HTTPS to be properly configured and functional).
    *   `Content-Security-Policy` (CSP): To mitigate cross-site scripting (XSS) and other code injection attacks. This requires careful planning and configuration specific to the web application.
*   **Effort:** **Medium** (Requires modifying Apache configuration files and potentially application code for CSP).
*   **Expected Risk Reduction:** **High**. Significantly reduces the attack surface for common web vulnerabilities like clickjacking, MIME-sniffing, and XSS.

*   **Specific Fix:** Update Apache to the latest stable version (currently 2.4.54 or later as per Nikto findings).
*   **Effort:** **Low** (Standard package update).
*   **Expected Risk Reduction:** **Low to Medium**. Addresses potential vulnerabilities in the web server itself, though the reported issues are configuration-related.

*   **Defensive Controls & Hardening:**
    *   Ensure all web traffic is served over HTTPS and enforce HSTS.
    *   Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to filter malicious traffic.
    *   Regularly review and update web server configurations.
*   **Monitoring & Detection:**
    *   Monitor web server access logs for suspicious requests.
    *   Implement security scanning for web applications to identify missing headers or other misconfigurations.
    *   Alert on any changes to the web server configuration.

### 3. Address SSH Weaknesses and Outdated Information

Several "medium" severity findings related to SSH indicate potential weaknesses or are informational, but still warrant attention for a robust security posture.

*   **Specific Fix:** Disable weak cryptographic ciphers and MACs, including SHA-1 HMAC, if they are enabled by default or through configuration. This is often achieved by specifying `Ciphers`, `MACs`, and `KexAlgorithms` in `sshd_config`.
*   **Effort:** **Low** (Configuration change).
*   **Expected Risk Reduction:** **Medium**. Enhances the security of SSH connections by using stronger cryptographic primitives.

*   **Specific Fix:** Ensure the SSH daemon is configured to not reveal excessive information about the server and its configuration, such as the specific version string (though this is often managed by the operating system).
*   **Effort:** **Low** (Configuration change, often related to `Banner` or other verbose options in `sshd_config`).
*   **Expected Risk Reduction:** **Low**. Reduces the information an attacker can gather for targeted attacks.

*   **Defensive Controls & Hardening:**
    *   Maintain a comprehensive inventory of all exposed services and their versions.
    *   Regularly review and update security best practice configurations for all services.
*   **Monitoring & Detection:**
    *   Implement vulnerability scanning as part of a regular security testing schedule.

*   **Disruption and Impact**: **Impact** techniques like **Exploitation for Impact (T1499)** can be used to disrupt operations, either as a primary objective or as a diversion for other activities. This capability underscores the potential for significant damage to the target environment.

The progression of attack capabilities is evident: extensive reconnaissance builds the foundation for gaining access, which in turn enables command execution and potential disruption.

### Threat Actor Perspective

From a threat actor's perspective, the current findings present a clear attack chain:

1.  **Initial Reconnaissance (Discovery)**:
    *   **Prerequisite**: Network access to the target.
    *   **Techniques**: **T1082 (System Information Discovery)**, **T1083 (System File Discovery)**.
    *   **Actor Action**: Leverage the numerous SSH and HTTP enumeration findings to identify the SSH server version (8.4p1 Debian 5+deb11u3) and its configurations, as well as web server details. This stage is relatively low-risk and provides crucial intelligence.

2.  **Exploiting Entry Points or Weaknesses (Initial Access / Credential Access)**:
    *   **Prerequisite**: Intelligence gathered in Stage 1, or direct internet exposure.
    *   **Techniques**:
        *   **T1189 (Exploit Public-Facing Application)**: If any public-facing applications have vulnerabilities, this would be an initial entry point.
        *   **T1110 (Exploitation for Credential Access)**: Exploit vulnerabilities related to SSH authentication. For instance, if the "Debian OpenSSH - (Authenticated) Remote SELinux Privilege Escalation" is exploitable, it could lead to elevated privileges. Alternatively, weaknesses in authentication methods could be targeted to gain access.
    *   **Actor Action**: Attempt to exploit specific identified vulnerabilities in SSH or other public-facing services to gain initial foothold or credentials.

3.  **Command Execution and System Control (Execution)**:
    *   **Prerequisite**: Successful initial access or credential compromise.
    *   **Technique**: **T1059 (Command and Scripting Interpreter)**.
    *   **Actor Action**: Use the identified remote command execution capabilities (e.g., from "FreeBSD OpenSSH 3.5p1 - Remote Command Execution") to execute arbitrary commands on the compromised system, establishing direct control.

4.  **Lateral Movement and Data Exfiltration (Discovery / Execution / Impact)**:
    *   **Prerequisite**: System control established in Stage 3.
    *   **Techniques**:
        *   **T1082 / T1083**: Further reconnaissance within the network.
        *   **T1059**: Execute commands for data staging and exfiltration.
        *   **T1499**: Potentially use denial-of-service capabilities to disrupt defenses or create distractions.
    *   **Actor Action**: Expand presence within the network, locate valuable data, and exfiltrate it. Disrupt operations if necessary.

### Defensive Gaps and Detection Opportunities

*   **High Likelihood of Success**:
    *   **T1082 (System Information Discovery)**: The sheer volume of findings suggests that current discovery mechanisms are not effectively restricted. Attackers can freely enumerate system information, providing them with a significant advantage.
    *   **T1110 (Exploitation for Credential Access)**: Vulnerabilities that bypass or weaken authentication are direct pathways to compromise. If these are not patched or mitigated, they represent a critical defensive gap.
    *   **T1059 (Command and Scripting Interpreter)**: The ability to execute arbitrary commands remotely indicates a failure in input validation or execution control.

*   **Detection Strategies**:
    *   **For T1082 (System Information Discovery)**:
        *   **Mitigation**: Limit information revealed by services.
        *   **Detection**: Monitor network traffic for excessive or unusual service enumeration queries. Implement anomaly detection for protocols like SSH and HTTP that reveal detailed version information. Log and alert on attempts to fingerprint services with known scanning tools.
    *   **For T1110 (Exploitation for Credential Access)**:
        *   **Mitigation**: Multi-factor authentication, strong password policies, regular patching of authentication services.
        *   **Detection**: Monitor for brute-force attempts, account lockouts, and repeated failed login attempts. Analyze authentication logs for anomalies and suspicious patterns. Implement intrusion detection systems (IDS) that can identify exploit attempts against authentication mechanisms.
    *   **For T1059 (Command and Scripting Interpreter)**:
        *   **Mitigation**: Principle of least privilege, secure coding practices to prevent command injection, restrict remote command execution capabilities.
        *   **Detection**: Monitor system logs for unusual process execution, command-line arguments, and script executions. Employ host-based intrusion detection systems (HIDS) to detect suspicious process behavior. Analyze network traffic for outbound connections initiated by unexpected processes.
    *   **For T1499 (Exploitation for Impact)**:
        *   **Mitigation**: Regular patching, resource management, rate limiting on services.
        *   **Detection**: Monitor system performance metrics for unusual spikes or drops in resource utilization. Analyze network traffic for denial-of-service attack patterns (e.g., SYN floods, UDP floods). Log and alert on service crashes or unexpected restarts.
    *   **For T1189 (Exploit Public-Facing Application)**:
        *   **Mitigation**: Regular patching of public-facing applications, web application firewalls (WAFs), vulnerability scanning.
        *   **Detection**: Monitor WAF logs for blocked exploit attempts. Analyze web server logs for suspicious requests that match known exploit patterns. Implement network IDS/IPS that can detect exploit signatures targeting public-facing applications.
